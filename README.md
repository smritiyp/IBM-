This project provides an in-depth analysis of global poverty and inequality, focusing on how these issues persist and evolve across different regions and demographics. Using data visualization and statistical models, the study illustrates the uneven distribution of wealth, access to education, and essential resources. It explores the socio-economic factors driving poverty and widening inequality, with a particular emphasis on the intersection of income, geography, and policy. Additionally, the analysis suggests actionable strategies, including economic reforms and targeted social programs, aimed at reducing poverty levels and narrowing the inequality gap on a global scale.
